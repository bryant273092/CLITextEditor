// Implementation of the KeypressInteractionReader

// YOU WILL NEED TO IMPLEMENT SOME THINGS HERE

#include "KeypressInteractionReader.hpp"
#include "InsertCommand.hpp"


// You will need to update this member function to watch for the right
// keypresses and build the right kinds of Interactions as a result.
//
// The reason you'll need to implement things here is that you'll need
// to create Command objects, which you'll be declaring and defining
// yourself; they haven't been provided already.
//
// I've added handling for "quit" here, but you'll need to add the others.
